Hey, Iâ€™m Shiwei. I go by Sonicforhire, or more recently, Astollfo on the internet.
Iâ€™m interested in Anime, Coding, and graduating from Highschool, and forgetting about everything that happened while I was in it.
Model UN sucks. Debate is sus, and I want to spend the rest of Highschool vibing to music and doing Computer Programming

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Coding, Japanese, Latin, Piano, Cello, Mathematics, Music Theory, and more resume padding.
